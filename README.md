# fruitCognition

A multi-agent reference application built on the AGNTCY Internet of Agents stack
(SLIM, NATS, A2A, MCP, LangGraph, Observe SDK), demonstrating how distributed
agents can collaborate inside a fruit-trading business: per-country fruit farms
(Mango / Apple / Banana / Strawberry), an auction supervisor, a logistics group
(shipper, accountant, helpdesk), an MCP weather tool, an MCP payment tool, and
a recruiter that discovers agents through the AGNTCY directory.

## Layout

| Path | What lives there |
|---|---|
| [`fruitAGNTCY/fruit_agents/fruit_cognition`](fruitAGNTCY/fruit_agents/fruit_cognition) | Full demo: 3 farms + auction supervisor + group-comm logistics + recruiter + UI. |
| [`fruitAGNTCY/fruit_agents/recruiter`](fruitAGNTCY/fruit_agents/recruiter) | Standalone recruiter agent backed by a Google ADK agent + AGNTCY `dirctl` tool. |
| `.github/workflows` | CI: per-service container builds → `ghcr.io/kubeages/fruit-agntcy/*`. |
